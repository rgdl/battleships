# Battleships

To begin with, this will be implemented with textual display, using `ncurses`.

Implement display to an interface so that openGL or similar can be substituted later.

First step, get basic board display with some test code.

What's missing?

* The ability to end the game, with a "game over" and shots taken screen
* clear text input after making a shot
* dedicate 3x3 characters to each display unit
* implement graphical display
