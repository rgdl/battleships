# Battleships

Single-player, text-based Battleships, implemented in C++ using ncurses. I may implement an alternative display class that users OpenGL or something instead.

### To build and play:
```
make
./Battleships
```

### To clean up afterwards:
```
make clean
```

## TODO:
* implement graphical display
